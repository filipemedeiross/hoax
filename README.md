# HOAX

## Application of Machine Learning Techniques to the Siema Database

   Siema is the IBAMA system responsible for registering reports of environmental accidents from citizens across Brazil. According to database, 28% of the reports are false, resulting in financial and human costs to the institution during the verification of these incidents. The proposal in this project is to use machine learning techniques to build a component called Hoax for Siema, with the aim of classifying future accident reports as valid or not.

   The article **Classificador de notificações de acidentes ambientais no Sistema Nacional de Emergências Ambientais do IBAMA** contained in `paper\` was submitted and approved at the XI Workshop de Computação Aplicada em Governo Eletrônico ([WCGE](https://csbc.sbc.org.br/2023/wcge/)), a satellite event of the 43º Congresso da Sociedade Brasileira de Computação (CSBC). It serves as a forum for presenting and discussing ICT techniques, methodologies, models, and tools to support Electronic Government initiatives.
